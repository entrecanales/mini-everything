# mini-everything
## Description
This project is done to provide a pseudo-everything small python program. This means this software will look for files with a certain name or a certain extension, and you can see the code so you can see there won't be anything nasty going on.

## How to run this
Have python3 installed in your machine and run it with "python mini-everything.py" That's it! The program will ask for the file or extension you're looking for.
